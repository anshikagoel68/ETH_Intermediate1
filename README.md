**Title:** ErrorHandlingMethods Contract
This contract provides an explanation of the ErrorHandlingMethods contract written in Solidity (version ^0.8.0).

**License**
This contract is licensed under the MIT License.

**Contract Overview**
The ErrorHandlingMethods contract manages a simple balance owned by a designated owner. It provides functions for depositing, withdrawing, transferring funds, and querying the contract's balance. 
The contract utilizes various error handling techniques to ensure secure and reliable operation.
The techniques/Methods are- require(), assert(), revert().

**Usage of Methods**
1). require():The require statement is used to enforce conditions that must be true for the function to execute successfully.
               If the condition evaluates to false, the transaction is reverted, and any changes made to the state are rolled back.
               It has two parameters, separated by comma.
               (a) condition to validate
               (b) String message to display onto the console window(enclosed in double quotes).

2). assert():The assert statement is used to check for conditions that should never be false.
             Unlike require, which checks for conditions that are expected to be recoverable and meaningful to the caller, assert is typically used to check for internal errors and to ensure that certain invariants are never violated.
             If an assert condition fails, it indicates a bug in the contract logic rather than an expected failure condition.
             It ensures that certain critical conditions always hold true.
             Verifying that internal state assumptions are never violated.
   
3). revert(): The revert statement is used to revert the current call. It can be used with a custom error message to provide information about why the revert occurred.

**Functions used in the contract**

1. deposit(uint amount)
   - Description: Allows the contract owner to deposit funds into the contract.
   - Requirements: Only the contract owner can deposit funds.
   - Effects: Increases the contract's balance by the specified amount.
   - Usage:Call with the amount of funds to deposit.

2. withdraw(uint amount)
   - Description: Allows the contract owner to withdraw funds from the contract.
   - Requirements: Only the contract owner can withdraw funds. The contract must have sufficient balance to cover the withdrawal amount.
   - Effects:Decreases the contract's balance by the specified amount.
   - Usage: Call with the amount of funds to withdraw.

3. transfer(address recipient, uint amount)
   - Description: Allows the contract owner to transfer funds to a specified recipient address.
   - Requirements: Only the contract owner can initiate transfers. The recipient address must not be the zero address. The contract must have sufficient balance to cover the transfer amount.
   - Effects: Decreases the contract's balance by the specified amount upon successful transfer.
   - Usage: Call with recipient's address and the amount of funds to transfer.

4. getBalance()
   - Description: Retrieves the current balance of the contract.
   - Effects:Does not modify the contract state.
   - Returns:The current balance of the contract.

- **Require Statements:**
  - Used to enforce conditions such as owner-only access and sufficient balance checks before executing functions (deposit, withdraw, transfer).
  
- **Assert Statement:**
  - Used internally in the `withdraw` function to ensure that the contract's balance is sufficient before deducting the withdrawal amount.

- **Revert Statement:**
  - Used in the `transfer` function to revert transactions that attempt to transfer funds to the zero address, ensuring that funds are not lost.
